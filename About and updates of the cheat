FAQ
How do I open menu?
Press INSERT key while focused on CS:GO window.

Where is my config file saved?
Configuration files are saved inside Osiris folder in your Documents folder (%USERPROFILE%\Documents\[hazu.alien]\[Settings]). The config is binary serialized so it is not meant to be edited by humans. Sometimes after updates configuration file needs to be deleted and recreated.
